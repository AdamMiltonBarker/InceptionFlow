##Inception V3

The Inception v3 model is a deep convolutional neural network released by Google, which has been pre-trained for the ImageNet Large Visual Recognition Challenge using data from 2012, and it can differentiate between 1,000 different classes, like “cat”, “dishwasher” or “plane”. The paper regarding Inception V3 is described in Google's Arxiv preprint ["Rethinking the Inception Architecture for Computer Vision”](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.00567 "Rethinking the Inception Architecture for Computer Vision").
